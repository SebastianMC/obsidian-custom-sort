## Challenges to address (as of 2.1.14):

- the initial notifications "Custom sorting ON" and "Parsing custom sorting specification SUCCEEDED!" 
  don't reflect the actual state in some cases - the custom sorting is not applied
- the notifications are shown more than once in some cases
- when the File Explorer is not visible on start (1.7.2 and the lazy views) it is not possible to auto-apply custom sort
  and attempting to do so ends up with an error
- there are more challenges when attempting to apply the custom sorting automatically on start

An idea of solution, not ideal, but acceptable at glance:
- simplify the logic of notifications - only show when successful
- introduce a new popup "Custom sorting was not applied automatically, apply now?"
  - only when it was enabled, only when the File Explorer view is visible
  - allow to disable this popup in settings (or via a checkbox "don't show it again")
- introduce a new popup "File Explorer view is not visible, cannot apply custom sort"
  - only when the user explicitly attempts to apply custom sort 

Additional remarks:
- [Brian Ray](https://github.com/bray) mentions a Lazy Plugin loader in #163
  - check it out and make sure it works correctly (gracefully, not necessarily auto-apply custom sort) 
- in some rare cases the custom sorting can be applied successfully on start
  - keep this scenario handled correctly
  - see #161 for the sequence of events (a) -> (f)

## Design

Before all, capture the sequences of key execution points and events (related to #161)

Logs below show some unexpected edge cases and sequences of events, e.g. Lazy Plugin Loader, when
  the metadataCache-resolved event never reaches the plugin

The metadataCache-resolved event becomes very problematic and thus useless. At the same current
implementation of the plugin relies on it heavily

Scenarios under consideration:
(1a) optimistic scenario of auto-sorting on start on the first display of File Explorer.
  - theoretically can happen, never observed on 1.7.2
  - metadataCache-resolved event is ignored in this scenario
  - UX is excellent
(1b) optimistic scenario of auto-sorting on start in response to metadataCache-resolved event
  - happens on desktop as the most frequent one
  - metadataCache-resolved event is triggering the custom sort almost immediately
  - UX also good, File Explorer appears with custom sorting, even if technically the std sorting was applied
  - on mobile the long-taking 'Obsidian is indexing your vault' can prevent the custom sort from being applied quickly
(2) the delayed scenario, e.g. Lazy Plugin Loader or for whatever reason
  - happens with Lazy Plugin Loader, by definition
  - can happen in regular cases when there a many plugins, slow machine or a large vault
  - metadataCache-resolved event is never raised for the plugin until an explicit edit made by user
  - File Explorer appears in std order, then is reloaded with custom order

Conclusions based on the above scenarios:
- the metadataCache-resolved event can be useful for (1b) both for quick and very delayed metadata cache population (e.g. on mobile) 
  - detection of the scenario can be tricky: only first execution, not trigger heavy processing when unprepared
  - relating to onLayoutReady could be helpful (do nothing before that)
- for (2) introduce a delayed checker of was-sorting-applied, e.g. every second, repeated N times (e.g. N=3) to support large vaults on slower devices

Log

Things turn out to be trickier than I expected.

Sample logs generated by current log-decorated version:

```
Scenario: File Explorer hidden on close, automatically hidden on start:
On end: File Explorer invisible, ribbon indicated 'sorting not applied, enabled'
c-s ep: (b pre-1) entered patchFileExplorerFolder()
c-s ep: (a pre-1) entered checkFileExplorerIsAvailableAndPatchable()
c-s ep: (a pre-2) this.getFileExplorer ok
c-s ep: (a) failed
c-s ep: (b) failed
c-s ep: (c) app metadataCache populated by Obsidian
c-s ep: (d pre-1) entered readAndParseSortingSpec()
c-s ep: (d) notify: Parsing custom sorting specification SUCCEEDED!
c-s ep: (a pre-1) entered checkFileExplorerIsAvailableAndPatchable()

```
Scenario: File Explorer visible and custom-sorted on close, for some reason hidden on start (a different view self-activates)
On end: File Explorer invisible, ribbon indicated 'sorting applied correctly'

c-s ep: (b pre-1) entered patchFileExplorerFolder()
c-s ep: (a pre-1) entered checkFileExplorerIsAvailableAndPatchable()
c-s ep: (a pre-2) this.getFileExplorer ok
c-s ep: (a pre-3) has requestSort()
c-s ep: (a) 1.6.0+ and has getSortedFolderItems()
c-s ep: (f pre-1) patched getSortedFolderItems factory!

Then after showing File Explorer:

(151x) c-s ep: (f) patched getSortedFolderItems invoked!
c-s ep: (f) patched getSortedFolderItems invoked!

Scenario: FE visible, sorting enabled, custom-sort plugin delayed via Lazy Plugin Loader
