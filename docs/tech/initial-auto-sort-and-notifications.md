## Challenges to address (as of 2.1.14):

- the initial notifications "Custom sorting ON" and "Parsing custom sorting specification SUCCEEDED!" 
  don't reflect the actual state in some cases - the custom sorting is not applied
- the notifications are shown more than once in some cases
- when the File Explorer is not visible on start (1.7.2 and the lazy views) it is not possible to auto-apply custom sort
  and attempting to do so ends up with an error
- there are more challenges when attempting to apply the custom sorting automatically on start

An idea of solution, not ideal, but acceptable at glance:
- simplify the logic of notifications - only show when successful
- introduce a new popup "Custom sorting was not applied automatically, apply now?"
  - only when it was enabled, only when the File Explorer view is visible
  - allow to disable this popup in settings (or via a checkbox "don't show it again")
- introduce a new popup "File Explorer view is not visible, cannot apply custom sort"
  - only when the user explicitly attempts to apply custom sort 

Additional remarks:
- [Brian Ray](https://github.com/bray) mentions a Lazy Plugin loader in #163
  - check it out and make sure it works correctly (gracefully, not necessarily auto-apply custom sort) 
- in some rare cases the custom sorting can be applied successfully on start
  - keep this scenario handled correctly
  - see #161 for the sequence of events (a) -> (f)

## Design

Before all, capture the sequences of key execution points and events (related to #161)

Log below shows some unexpected edge cases and sequences of events, e.g. Lazy Plugin Loader, when
  the metadata-cache-populated event never reaches the plugin

Is it possible / feasible to both:
- handle the optimistic scenario of auto-sorting on start on the first display of File Explorer? AND
- gracefully handle the delayed scenario, e.g. Lazy Plugin Loader or for whatever reason?

The delayed scenario, should be handled with a popup and explicit user confirmation
- can this scenario be indeed correctly recognised and not confused with other scenarios
  in which the automatic sorting should not be applied?

Log

Things turn out to be trickier than I expected.

Sample logs generated by current log-decorated version:

```
Scenario: File Explorer hidden on close, automatically hidden on start:
On end: File Explorer invisible, ribbon indicated 'sorting not applied, enabled'
c-s ep: (b pre-1) entered patchFileExplorerFolder()
c-s ep: (a pre-1) entered checkFileExplorerIsAvailableAndPatchable()
c-s ep: (a pre-2) this.getFileExplorer ok
c-s ep: (a) failed
c-s ep: (b) failed
c-s ep: (c) app metadataCache populated by Obsidian
c-s ep: (d pre-1) entered readAndParseSortingSpec()
c-s ep: (d) notify: Parsing custom sorting specification SUCCEEDED!
c-s ep: (a pre-1) entered checkFileExplorerIsAvailableAndPatchable()
c-s ep: (a pre-2) this.getFileExplorer ok
c-s ep: (a) failed
```

```
Scenario: File Explorer visible and custom-sorted on close, for some reason hidden on start (a different view self-activates)
On end: File Explorer invisible, ribbon indicated 'sorting applied correctly'

c-s ep: (b pre-1) entered patchFileExplorerFolder()
c-s ep: (a pre-1) entered checkFileExplorerIsAvailableAndPatchable()
c-s ep: (a pre-2) this.getFileExplorer ok
c-s ep: (a pre-3) has requestSort()
c-s ep: (a) 1.6.0+ and has getSortedFolderItems()
c-s ep: (f pre-1) patched getSortedFolderItems factory!
c-s ep: (b) 1.6.0+ and patched getSortedFolderItems()
c-s ep: (c) app metadataCache populated by Obsidian
c-s ep: (d pre-1) entered readAndParseSortingSpec()
c-s ep: (d) notify: Parsing custom sorting specification SUCCEEDED!
c-s ep: (a pre-1) entered checkFileExplorerIsAvailableAndPatchable()
c-s ep: (a pre-2) this.getFileExplorer ok
c-s ep: (a pre-3) has requestSort()
c-s ep: (a) 1.6.0+ and has getSortedFolderItems()

Then after showing File Explorer:

(151x) c-s ep: (f) patched getSortedFolderItems invoked!
c-s ep: (f) patched getSortedFolderItems invoked!
```

```
Scenario: fully valid end-to-end: FE visible and custom-sorted, reload
On end: File Explorer visible and sorted, ribbon indicated 'sorting applied correctly'

c-s ep: (b pre-1) entered patchFileExplorerFolder()
c-s ep: (a pre-1) entered checkFileExplorerIsAvailableAndPatchable()
c-s ep: (a pre-2) this.getFileExplorer ok
c-s ep: (a pre-3) has requestSort()
c-s ep: (a) 1.6.0+ and has getSortedFolderItems()
c-s ep: (f pre-1) patched getSortedFolderItems factory!
c-s ep: (b) 1.6.0+ and patched getSortedFolderItems()
c-s ep: (c) app metadataCache populated by Obsidian
c-s ep: (d pre-1) entered readAndParseSortingSpec()
c-s ep: (d) notify: Parsing custom sorting specification SUCCEEDED!
c-s ep: (a pre-1) entered checkFileExplorerIsAvailableAndPatchable()
c-s ep: (a pre-2) this.getFileExplorer ok
c-s ep: (a pre-3) has requestSort()
c-s ep: (a) 1.6.0+ and has getSortedFolderItems()
(151z) c-s ep: (f) patched getSortedFolderItems invoked!
c-s ep: (f) patched getSortedFolderItems invoked!
(151x) c-s ep: (f) patched getSortedFolderItems invoked!
c-s ep: (f) patched getSortedFolderItems invoked!
```

```
Scenario: FE visible, sorting enabled, custom-sort plugin delayed via Lazy Plugin Loader
On end: File Explorer visible and not sorted, ribbon indicates 'sorting enabled but not applied'

c-s ep: (b pre-1) entered patchFileExplorerFolder()
c-s ep: (a pre-1) entered checkFileExplorerIsAvailableAndPatchable()
c-s ep: (a pre-2) this.getFileExplorer ok 
c-s ep: (a pre-3) has requestSort()
c-s ep: (a) 1.6.0+ and has getSortedFolderItems()
c-s ep: (f pre-1) patched getSortedFolderItems factory!
c-s ep: (b) 1.6.0+ and patched getSortedFolderItems()
```
